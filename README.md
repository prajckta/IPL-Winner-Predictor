Developed a ML model to forecast the winner of IPL
cricket matches using historical data. Implemented
a Random Forest classifier to predict match
outcomes on complex datasets.

Key aspects of the project included:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered extensive historical data on IPL matches, including player statistics, team performance, and match conditions. Conducted thorough data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and relevance.

2. Feature Engineering: Utilized various correlation matrices to analyze relationships between features and outcomes, enhancing the feature selection process. This involved identifying and incorporating key variables that influence match results.

3. Model Implementation: Implemented a Random Forest classifier to handle the complexity and variability in the dataset. The model was tuned and evaluated using cross-validation techniques to ensure robustness and accuracy.

4. Outcome Prediction: The model generated predictions for match outcomes, providing insights and forecasts based on historical trends and patterns.


This project showcased the application of machine learning techniques in sports analytics and provided valuable predictions to support strategic decision-making.
